The product is very good. Initially, you might get overwhelmed seeing the plethora of attachments provided but it is quite easy to figure out. You might not need every attachment, the seller has provided them in case you need them - for people who are setting it up in bigger gardens.The main pipe is quite long and I guess you can make more holes and water more than 32 plants if you are setting it up in a balcony or plants are close by. You can also buy additional accessories from the official site to expand the set up.However, some of the joints can leak little water, use m-seal and fix them up. In my case only one joint leaked, maybe because the hole i punched was not proper.Special bonus points to the seller - I had some issues regarding some attachments and contacted the seller (you can get the whatsapp number from official site) and he was very polite, solved my issues promptly.

Filling it up is simple, and pumping the pressure mechanism is smooth and doesn\'t require a lot of effort.Adjustable nozzle: The nozzle adjusts from a fine mist to a jet stream, which is great for different watering needs. I use the mist setting for my delicate seedlings and the jet for rinsing off pests or dirty leaves.Lightweight: This sprayer is made of plastic, so it\'s very lightweight and comfortable to hold, even when it\'s full. This makes it easy to maneuver around my plants without getting tired.Good value: For the price, I think this sprayer is a great value. It seems well-made and sturdy, and it does exactly what I need it to do.Overall, I\'m very pleased with this Kraft Seeds pressure sprayer.

I bought it to maintain my plants and give them a regular shower, but I am deeply disapointed by the quality and function of it. Here is my reason why:- the handle is really instable and weak for a fully filled (2L) bottle, the entire gun (spray/pump/handle) unit is low quality and super cheaply produced. The handle bends under the weight, which confirms predecessing reviewers.- the pump shaft is not tight and rather loosely put into the gun unit; hence wobbling around, which makes it prone for breaking the unit sooner or later as it introduces an angle to the pump shaft. Every engineer will cnfirm those physics.- the adjustable nozzle is of poor quality. It is half metal, half plastic. If you dont tight up the lower plasic part the bottle will just release water and pressure without even touching the trigger. The metal part is borderline to fall apart when setting it to a mist sparey setting in oppose to a straight beam of water. You twist ti a millimeter too far, it comes off. If you twisst it a millimeter too less, its no mist spray any more- the biggest disappointment is however the way it is designed to process the water. That indeed is a design failure as you cannot use the spray bottle in an angle if your water level falls below 1L. Reason is, the internal feeder pipe will then be outside the water level and just suck up the airpressure rather than the water. It only works if you keep the bottle in a perfect vertical, leveled position. Which in effect defeats the entire purpose of that spray bottle.On a side note, you cannot use the bottle upside down. Ok, that was not mentioned in the product description, but I guess you should know, especially if you have a little sophistication in gardening.Thus please save your cash and spend it on a different product. Maybe even spend an extra dime to pick up a quality product, rather than polluting our environment by throwing it away sooner or later.P.S. funniest thing is, it has something like \'meet quality\' printed on it - irony in its purest form','True','B01HQCKG4O','NEGATIVE'),(104,3,'Nozzle not working','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1SQRV407HS8J8?ASIN=B01HQCKG4O','Reviewed in India on 29 May 2024','Nozzle not working properly after 3-4 uses.','True','B01HQCKG4O','NEGATIVE'),(105,5,'Quality','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R25DS2PVSIVFAG?ASIN=B01HQCKG4O','Reviewed in India on 23 July 2024','Product quality is good and easy to operate','True','B01HQCKG4O','POSITIVE'),(106,4,'Good quality product','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R227EG4SBAKI7J?ASIN=B01HQCKG4O','Reviewed in India on 10 December 2023','First supplied product was with a defective spray nozzle which was promptly replaced by the seller immediately.

They might rot.When I got it I did the test with compacting it in my fist with some water and the soil clumped together. This was not a good sign. However, I trusted the reviews on Amazon and I repotted peace lilly, palm and a small rose plant. Within a few days I could see the plants deteriorating. I waited for 3 weeks because sometimes these things can resolve themselves. After over a month most of the peace lilly leaves had started to yellow, the rose bush had deteriorated and was at death\'s door.Yesterday we have repotted again.

The amount of force applied while using this cutter can vary from person to person. This means that individual results may vary, depending on the user\'s strength and technique.Additionally I have found that the hand grip of the cutter to be quiet uncomfortable when cutting larger branches.

They are an excellent choice for environmentally conscious gardeners and farmers. Here are some common types of organic fertilizers and their benefits:Compost:Source: Decomposed organic matter, such as kitchen scraps, yard waste, and manure.Benefits: Rich in organic matter, compost improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a balanced range of nutrients. It enhances microbial activity in the soil.Manure:Source: Animal waste, such as cow, chicken, or horse manure.Benefits: A good source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Manure also adds organic matter to the soil and helps improve soil fertility.Bone Meal:Source: Ground bones, usually from cattle.Benefits: High in phosphorus, bone meal is beneficial for flowering and fruiting plants. It contributes to root development and overall plant strength.Fish Emulsion:Source: Fish waste and remains.Benefits: Provides a quick source of nitrogen, as well as phosphorus and potassium. It is often used as a liquid fertilizer and promotes vigorous plant growth.Blood Meal:Source: Dried and powdered animal blood, usually from cattle.Benefits: High in nitrogen, blood meal is excellent for promoting leafy green growth in plants. It\'s a fast-acting organic fertilizer.Seaweed/Kelp Fertilizer:Source: Extracts from seaweed or kelp.Benefits: Rich in trace minerals, seaweed fertilizer enhances plant growth, improves stress resistance, and promotes overall plant health.Cover Crops:Source: Various plants grown to cover and protect the soil.Benefits: Leguminous cover crops, like clover, add nitrogen to the soil through a process called nitrogen fixation. Cover crops also prevent erosion and improve soil fertility.Green Manure:Source: Plants, such as legumes, that are grown and then plowed back into the soil.Benefits: Adds organic matter, improves soil structure, and releases nutrients as it decomposes.When using organic fertilizers, it\'s important to note that they release nutrients more slowly compared to synthetic fertilizers. Patience is key, as organic fertilizers contribute to long-term soil health and sustainability. Additionally, the choice of organic fertilizer may depend on the specific nutrient needs of the plants and the soil conditions. Always follow recommended application rates to avoid over-fertilizing.','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(293,3,'Fertiliser is not good for plants','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1MIVWVPW0BG2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 8 July 2024','Waste of money.','True','B08D8CHZ9C','NEGATIVE'),(294,5,'It\'s good for growth of my plant','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/ROSHU7S2AKR1Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 7 May 2024','I brought this format plants good growth','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(295,4,'Best for plant','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R239B4YSKHVCOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 10 March 2024','It\'s really good','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(296,1,'Appears to city waste compost Not vermi compost','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2MBM6RVGB21B5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 21 June 2024','Please do not from this supplier, It do not appear to be vermi compost at all.

These are1. 1 transplanter2. 1 trowel3. 1 fork or weeder4. 1 rake5. 1 flower clipper6. 1 stem/twig clipper or pruner#1 - #5 seem to be of good quality.The wrought iron (or so it seems) part of these implements is sturdy and didn\'t appear to have any defects. Will post an update if these start rusting - no such signs thus far. The handles are made of good quality hard plastic and the joints well attached (at least so far).#6 is where the quality starts to deteriorate. The pruner has good quality metal clippers but the handles (and the spring holding them together) feels so light and delicate that you feel it will come apart at the slightest touch. There is a lock to prevent it from springing apart which works quite well though.- There is a pair of gardening gloves that are, again, not the best quality and came a bit stuck together - possibly melted owing to the hot weather. This doesn\'t quite augur well for one hasn\'t bought this for one season but for a few!- 1 packet of seeds - we got those of the Zinnia plant,  not sure if this is consistent across all packages.Finally, the container box to hold all items is quite a disappointment. While it has a handy notch at one end that aids easy handling and movement it is the flimsiest item of the lot. The lid doesn\'t close properly and the plastic itself is a bit misshapen and bends far too easily. Not sure how long it will hold up. It wasn\'t a deal breaker though.All in all, it is a handy utilitarian package and one I recommend to new and seasoned gardeners alike.','True','B08486M79K','NEUTRAL'),(336,4,'The gardening tools are very easy to handle','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2TYXTTE5FPN95/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08486M79K','Reviewed in India on 12 June 2024','Very useful for those who love gardening, love taking care of plants in their homes','True','B08486M79K','POSITIVE'),(337,5,'Excellent product','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1LYZR856WO4AR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08486M79K','Reviewed in India on 24 July 2024','All the products in the box are solid and good to have.

First let\'s talk about the quality of the product the material quality is top notch no doubts at all (note that don\'t use it in hard soil or if you\'re not sure if there are stones in soil it will break the tip and then it will be of no use).It has 3 meters in it one for checking how moist is the soil which helps a lot sometimes top layer of the soil may be dry but inner layer may be moist and if you water the plants it will eventually kill the plant by rooting the roots. The 2nd meter is the light meter which is for me very beneficial because I have a lot of indor plants and now I can keep a check on how much light my plants are receiving and can adjust them accordingly the 3rd one and the most important for me is the PH level meter it will show you if the soil is alkaline or acid is nature and if you\'re plants are not growing properly and if they are dying even though they are receiving proper sunlight and water than my friend it because of the soil in which you have kept them and the PH meter helps you in understanding if the soil is good for plants or not and you can add fertilizers or change the soil accordingly.I bought this mainly for my Alocasia which leaves were drying even though it used to receive proper sunlight (which the plant requires to grow) and also the watering was correct but because of the soil being acidic in nature the plant was unable to grow properly and the leaves were drying and with the help of the meter I could make the changes accordingly and now my Alocasia is doing amazing...Even tried the meter with my other plants like monstera, snake plant, lemon.....(can\'t name all I have around 70 of them)It\'s worth every single penny.','True','B07BFVM59Z','POSITIVE'),(390,2,'Moisture meter','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R38TNBRXVCAENA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 11 May 2024','The media could not be loaded.\n                Quality issues , Light meter does not work properly','True','B07BFVM59Z','NEGATIVE'),(391,3,'So So','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1HAVFSSUG25PL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 19 May 2024','Its lying in Almira','True','B07BFVM59Z','NEUTRAL'),(392,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R289Q7UVNAHNE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 21 March 2024','Discover the transformative power of this product – it\'s not just about how much water your plant receives, but about the flourishing difference it makes in your plant\'s life.

Perfect for professional use.Eventhough the product is excellent still many users are reviewing it to negative as far as leakage is concerned. It is because of the ignorance while assembling the extension pipe provided in the pack. Manufacturer has given several O ring rubber washers in a separate pouch but it seems most of the buyers are  manifesting that as a mere additional accessory which may not be useful for its regular use.But it is totally wrong.There is a cap provided in the pack for attaching the extension pipe with the water injector module .It has to be tightened after inserting the O ring washer in between. Otherwise water leakage from the joint is a most probable outcome.Once the washer is attached the unit will perform flawless.Perhaps a common user may not recognize the importance of  an O ring washer in  water supply.It can be visible in our home plumbing .From a wash basin to an electric geyser the role of washers are not so least.Even the jaguar Taps will start to leak between the tap and the tube connecting to the mains line  without an O ring .This product deserves nothing less than 5 stars and those who gave less than 5 stars for reasons other than leakage have overlooked the product.Since it is a pressure sprayer designed for  watering and spraying pesticides to plants and not  to replace any pressure wash for cleaning cars or algae. Every product is expected to perform some function and never discontent with that only because it is not performing some other function.This is purely a manual pressure sprayer designed to sprinkle pesticide or water at a nominal pressure and for the same purpose 120 or 140 bar is not at all required.It cannot be used to clean vehicle as the pressure is not at all sufficient for self cleaning without wiping.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(404,4,'Intended for Rooftop gardeners','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2VT3423H73H3D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 28 August 2022','If you have 150-200 pots to feed liquid nutrients, this is the best option for you. But for 600 pot owners, I would suggest a full 16 litre sprayer. I have to feed at least 9-10 litres of liquid to my plants time to time, so I preferred this 8 litre sprayer, which is light weight and easy to carry. Kissankraft sprayer comes with two types of carrying system. One can hang it from soldier by strap or can carry by handle. I prefer the second one. The pumper has a locking system and locked pumper becomes carrying handle. The sprayer nozzle and pipe can cover 5 feet radius, so positioning it nearby a set of pots, drenching them and carrying it in another spot is less tiresome than all time carrying it by strap.Pumper is very easy going. At least 30-32 push is necessary in a set and you have to repeat it a few times to spray full 8 litre. Nozzle rod is made of plastic, light weight and sturdy. Same is true for the body parts.There is a convenient pressure release valve and a sprayer push lock to continue spraying without a fatigued finger.I found many reviews complaining about leakage although did not experienced any. I did not used spare valves provided with it, just tightened parts before using, and it working fine. Flow is flawless.Only negative side is, this pumper does not comes with an extended base. So best keep it for rooftop gardening.

My bike (Unicorn 150) and Scooter (Jupiter 125-19 Features more than Latest Activas) gets too much dust. The day I received this Kisan Kraft 8 liter manual sprayer, I was very happy and surprised that in just 8 liter of water, I can clean my bike completely by self and avoid standing in queue at washing station. My only regret is, I should have ordered it years ago (LOL I didn\'t knew when this product entered market). Just fill 8 liter of water and pump 20 times. If you feel pressure is not good then pump again few more times and spray clean. Repeat the cycle until water is no more. For me it takes 3 cycle of 20 times pump. I first adjust the nozzle to sprinkle and wet my bike. Wait for 5 min. Then I adjust the nozzle to thin water pressure to pressure wash my bike. Some times I first sprinkle water and then take a coir brush and shampoo (Sunsilk Rs. 1 packet) and rub over my bike. Then I pressure wash. That\'s all in 8 liter of water. Its almost a miracle. Amazing product!!!This Rs. 1000 product could literally save many thousands.I also washed the outdoor and indoor unit of my AC and my god I never imagined the amount of dust was in there. My entire floor was almost black as the dust got mixed with water. That was crazy. Now even at 29c + Ceiling fan at medium speed, my AC gives hill station feeling in Summer. Again Amazing manual pressure washer!!!Bonus tips:1. After using, untight the handle in by 10% to prevent damage to the rubber O ring. If you ask why, answer is, if product is not in use and you screw it tightly then the rubber O rings may damage being subjected to constant pressure.2. Sprinkle with nozzle just 1cm away from the fins when cleaning AC\'s internal unit.3.

My experience with your cocopeat is a mixed one. my experience with the earlier order was very good. But with this order it is of disapointment. I shall try to explain. The consistency of the earlier supply of cocopeat was a little coarse (not powdery). being a coarse medium, the roots of Microgreens that I grow, could easily breath (yes the roots breath too). Where as the supply I got through this order turned out to be very powdery in consistency. This causes lots of avoidable complications. For instance, the medium tend to stick to the surfaces of the container. also due to very dense consistency, the roots  find it difficult to breath.

I purchased it when it was INR 269, and the next day the price dropped by INR 40, it was 229.

Soft backing and allows for adjustment.This is a much better option than anything I’ve tried before to tie plants. With others, you have to make the knot, while with this one, you simply put one end on top of the other and it snaps into place without any effort. I was very surprised at the stronghold too! It will not easily snap off unless you pull it apart. I also like that it has a very soft feel so it won’t damage the stems. You can also very easily adjust it to allow for expansion or growth in the future. I would suggest using a longer piece to allow for adjustments later as needed. Definitely glad I found this product.

While it does its job effectively, it\'s hard to justify the relatively high cost, especially when there are more affordable options available in the market.Secondly, my main gripe with this product is the branding. The company has prominently displayed their branding on the wire organizer, and this branding is clearly visible when you use it for your plants. Personally, I prefer my plants to look clean and tidy without any external branding interfering with their natural beauty.

I have to really \'pull\' the cord to start it. I see that the machine runs for over one and a half hr with one liter petrol while cutting grass/shrub mixed lot at half throttle. The arrangement provided as the throttle stop is  convenient for this purpose, though it would have been more convenient if the rpm/power could be further reduced with the same set up. Full throttle will be too powerful for grass cutting, I think. The worst part is that the entire weight of the handle/shaft/flexible shaft is to be taken in the hands while the engine rests conveniently on the back. I don\'t believe anyone can use this backpack machine for more than an hr non-stop! The natural position for cutting comes a bit stooping (unless he is short) and that will tell on your back.  If one adjusts the handle to balance the handle weight, he will end up too near the cutting blade/wheel and his body bent too far; and if he adjusts the handle-grip to keep a safe distance it will weigh down on his arms! That is what is really troubling me. I am afraid I\'m going to have to buy a sidepack as this backpack has failed my expectation.Edit after a few more hours of operation: Now the engine has started stalling after operating for a while, every time. Start it, use it for 15-20 minutes  and the engine stutters and stops. And I have used the machine only for about 9-10 hours in all.

When I finally did:1. The product arrived one day before due date.2. It was impeccably packed.3. Each count was correct - including the manual. This is a little difficult to locate as it’s only a small card, printed on reverse of the packing slip. I also received the 20 extra red  sprinklers as promised.4. Installation was fairly easy - though it was done largely by a friend who is good with plumbing and repairs.5. The item quality turned out to be very, very good. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️6. There were leakages at a couple of points where we had inserted the winged connectors in main line.  These were fixed easily with a bit of twisting and some m-seal.But all things are not perfect. The red sprinklers can be regulated to some extent - but not like the shower in your bathroom. They keep dribbling or overshooting. However, we found a good use for these and snuck them between two half round pots, thus serving both pots with one pipe. See picThe black drippers can be unscrewed for cleaning - but you can’t stop them from dripping. So don’t try.Tips:1. Don’t start off cutting this into pieces straightaway. Fit and test one line before taking up the rest.2. Draw a rough plan of how the layout will be, where do you need T connectors and elbow bends and where all you need to regulate or stop the flow of water.3. If possible don’t use the tap connector supplied by Cingaro to connect the system to main tap. Use a soft hose pipe and a clamp for this. See pic.4. Fixing the winged t connectors into the 4 mm pipe is a nightmare with bare hands. Your thumb and fingers will get sore in half an hour. Soften the end of the 4 mm pipe by heating it slightly, and use a gardening glove to twist the t in. Remember that the slanted end goes into the 16 mm pipe, straight end into the 4 mm pipe.5. You will need to figure out the time you need to leave this on by trial and error. A 9” plastic pot needs about 100-300 ml water. The drippers are rated for 1 litre per hour. So if you leave the system on for about 5-15 minutes, your plants will get enough water.6. If you have small and large pots, you can order other types of drippers separately and use them on the same line. Green ones are rated at 2 litres per hour.7. If you want to fit it and forget it, you will have to order a timer valve. You can get a multi outlet timer valve also, if you want separate times and setting for leafy and flowering plants.Because the system is so flexible, it will very nearly do everything you ask it to do. Except plucking the flowers!

The system does not require a high flow rate/pressure. I connect it to my main water line at flow rate of about 1l/min and it works without hassles. The loosest fit is the dripper which is at risk to come loose if high water pressure is used.Adjustability : This I would consider somewhat of a con in that it\'s not a drip irrigation. The flow rate at the slowest from the dripper is at around 49ml/min, which is quite high. So within 10mins u will have watered about 500ml . Further there is no option to turn off the dripper. To stop flow u need to unplug the dripper and block the 4mm pipe.Appearance: Quite aesthetic looking if u route the main supply pipe properly. My suggestion here would be to place the main pipe (16mm) at a higher level and the 4mm pipe to be connected along the bottom to go downwards. (Have ordered more main pipe and will post photos once my system is set)Value for money: definitely as at ₹500-600 for 30 plants, u can just turn on the mains and forget it for the time u want to water.(else u lose around 1/2 hr watering each plant individially) If u use an irrigation timer even this much attention will not be required.To sum up:Pros:Works as advertisedFit it and forget it - hence time savingDoesn\'t require much water pressure.Cons:Dripper fitting is on the looser sideSlowest drip rate is ~50ml/minNo option to turn the dripper off.Suggestions:Use sprinkler type end drippers along with these drip ones if u need to cover a wider ground area(e.g. in gardens where u might have a mix of plants growing on the ground and in pots)','True','B07GMVDTH1','POSITIVE'),(1022,5,'Excellent Quality Product','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1GSP86SWA522C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07GMVDTH1','Reviewed in India on 18 May 2024','The media could not be loaded.\n                My name Dhananjay Singh, I ordered this drip irrigation system for our Dhyan Ashram\'s small phoolwadi, The quality of the product is very good, the fitting, adjustability is good.

There is no leakage issues because of proper usage of rubber washers. I too felt little issues with water refilling but the manual guides u well. There is nothing wrong with it because of less grip on upper inside of funnel it look difficult to dissemble. Instead of opening it from top anticlockwise you go from bottom side CLOCKWISE.

Not stainless steel and not acceptable. Beware the blade will get rusted and then it won\'t be usable. Rusting images attached.CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIAL QUALITY: (Serious problem)The chrome plating was getting off exposing rust on tin metal caps over wooden handles. Disappointed ⚠️The plastic bumper shock absorbers are a failed design. Tiny plastic caps are plugged on metal handle frame which is flimsy and wobbly. Will definitely break over use and when it will break the scissors will pass through making it unusable. SERIOUS PROBLEMThe blades are said  to be Vanadium stainless steel but IT GETS RUSTED even after taking care within 2 months. The blades are at 26cm (usable length is 21cm) and thickness is 0.3mm.The blades are riveted strongly with metal handle bars which in turn is firmly fixed with wooden handles.Also there is this yellow hand held knob that makes it easy to tighten or loosen the sheer.Sturdiness is excellent.CUTTING PERFORMANCE:The 0.3mm thick super sharp blades can cut from paper to thick branches. It can easily cut through thick bushes, hard twigs, thick branches. I am very satisfied with the sharpness of the product.I had no problem chopping through rose, lemon, bougainvillea and other plants whose names i don\'t know in english (overall nothing i could find in its range that it can\'t chop that doesn\'t mean you are all set to cut mango tree).There is a U shaped ridge on one blade which is used to latch on thich branches to facilitate cutting. Makes cutting thick branches (1.5-2 cm in diameter) so easyThe regulated movements are easy. Initially there was greese preapplied in between the blades.Very much easy to use.Made in India','True','B075BWSTQ9','NEGATIVE'),(1147,4,'Very useful','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RHOCHBPQU6MPX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075BWSTQ9','Reviewed in India on 13 June 2024','Very useful','True','B075BWSTQ9','POSITIVE'),(1148,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1LPSM8S13LIZR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075BWSTQ9','Reviewed in India on 17 May 2024','Like','True','B075BWSTQ9','POSITIVE'),(1149,5,'A common handle fitting most Wolf Garten products','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R6V36CIXXWU12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0009I9Z4A','Reviewed in India on 5 August 2023','Having a small garden requires a small but very effective set of implements, which must be affordable.

It has rechargeable Li battery and is very convenient and easy to use. The size is appropriate for home gardeners. And the pressure lasts till the end. Also, no requirement of manual pumping is a big relief!The battery charged quite fast. How long the battery shall recharge  will be known only after use for a few months.There were 2 big washers and a c-Type cable and long spout as accessories. However, it is the small rubber washer used with the small spout that breaks since that is the part which is moved to set the size of the spray. Spares for the small washer should be included (see 2nd pic).

The product is very good. Initially, you might get overwhelmed seeing the plethora of attachments provided but it is quite easy to figure out. You might not need every attachment, the seller has provided them in case you need them - for people who are setting it up in bigger gardens.The main pipe is quite long and I guess you can make more holes and water more than 32 plants if you are setting it up in a balcony or plants are close by. You can also buy additional accessories from the official site to expand the set up.However, some of the joints can leak little water, use m-seal and fix them up. In my case only one joint leaked, maybe because the hole i punched was not proper.Special bonus points to the seller - I had some issues regarding some attachments and contacted the seller (you can get the whatsapp number from official site) and he was very polite, solved my issues promptly. So, I guess you can always contact him if you have problem setting up the system.

I bought it to maintain my plants and give them a regular shower, but I am deeply disapointed by the quality and function of it. Here is my reason why:- the handle is really instable and weak for a fully filled (2L) bottle, the entire gun (spray/pump/handle) unit is low quality and super cheaply produced. The handle bends under the weight, which confirms predecessing reviewers.- the pump shaft is not tight and rather loosely put into the gun unit; hence wobbling around, which makes it prone for breaking the unit sooner or later as it introduces an angle to the pump shaft. Every engineer will cnfirm those physics.- the adjustable nozzle is of poor quality. It is half metal, half plastic. If you dont tight up the lower plasic part the bottle will just release water and pressure without even touching the trigger. The metal part is borderline to fall apart when setting it to a mist sparey setting in oppose to a straight beam of water. You twist ti a millimeter too far, it comes off. If you twisst it a millimeter too less, its no mist spray any more- the biggest disappointment is however the way it is designed to process the water. That indeed is a design failure as you cannot use the spray bottle in an angle if your water level falls below 1L. Reason is, the internal feeder pipe will then be outside the water level and just suck up the airpressure rather than the water. It only works if you keep the bottle in a perfect vertical, leveled position. Which in effect defeats the entire purpose of that spray bottle.On a side note, you cannot use the bottle upside down. Ok, that was not mentioned in the product description, but I guess you should know, especially if you have a little sophistication in gardening.Thus please save your cash and spend it on a different product.

Also it holds the water content so the soil remains wet and you don\'t have to water your plants unless it is a sunny day or high temperature is maintained. Sometimes it was observed that after watering the plants, the texture of the soil get ruined but not with this one.The fertility of this soil is good, seeds gets easily germinated. You don\'t have to feed your plants with fertilizer for 1 month after potting this soil because it is well formed soil and have fertilizer already added in it with other necessary contents.Conclusion: although the price is high because locally you can purchase more soil at the same price rate but this potting soil from trustbasket have all the necessary nutrients which are needed by your plants in order to grow and develop themselves so the price gets justified.

Every time I call they just send an automated message saying \"I will call you right back\" but I never receive a call back.Due to their such behavior I feel they are just importing some cheap disposable type Chinese machines & sell online with \"Sell & Forget\" policy by pushing up the buyers\' ratings by offering extended warranty if the buyer gives their 4+ rating.

This means that individual results may vary, depending on the user\'s strength and technique.Additionally I have found that the hand grip of the cutter to be quiet uncomfortable when cutting larger branches. The grip is made of foam, which can make it challenging to maintain a frim hold during prolonged use.The major concern I have Is safety lock of the cutter, as it broken within 2 months of use.

They are an excellent choice for environmentally conscious gardeners and farmers. Here are some common types of organic fertilizers and their benefits:Compost:Source: Decomposed organic matter, such as kitchen scraps, yard waste, and manure.Benefits: Rich in organic matter, compost improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a balanced range of nutrients. It enhances microbial activity in the soil.Manure:Source: Animal waste, such as cow, chicken, or horse manure.Benefits: A good source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Manure also adds organic matter to the soil and helps improve soil fertility.Bone Meal:Source: Ground bones, usually from cattle.Benefits: High in phosphorus, bone meal is beneficial for flowering and fruiting plants. It contributes to root development and overall plant strength.Fish Emulsion:Source: Fish waste and remains.Benefits: Provides a quick source of nitrogen, as well as phosphorus and potassium. It is often used as a liquid fertilizer and promotes vigorous plant growth.Blood Meal:Source: Dried and powdered animal blood, usually from cattle.Benefits: High in nitrogen, blood meal is excellent for promoting leafy green growth in plants. It\'s a fast-acting organic fertilizer.Seaweed/Kelp Fertilizer:Source: Extracts from seaweed or kelp.Benefits: Rich in trace minerals, seaweed fertilizer enhances plant growth, improves stress resistance, and promotes overall plant health.Cover Crops:Source: Various plants grown to cover and protect the soil.Benefits: Leguminous cover crops, like clover, add nitrogen to the soil through a process called nitrogen fixation. Cover crops also prevent erosion and improve soil fertility.Green Manure:Source: Plants, such as legumes, that are grown and then plowed back into the soil.Benefits: Adds organic matter, improves soil structure, and releases nutrients as it decomposes.When using organic fertilizers, it\'s important to note that they release nutrients more slowly compared to synthetic fertilizers. Patience is key, as organic fertilizers contribute to long-term soil health and sustainability. Additionally, the choice of organic fertilizer may depend on the specific nutrient needs of the plants and the soil conditions. Always follow recommended application rates to avoid over-fertilizing.','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(1936,3,'Fertiliser is not good for plants','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1MIVWVPW0BG2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 8 July 2024','Waste of money.','True','B08D8CHZ9C','NEGATIVE'),(1937,5,'It\'s good for growth of my plant','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/ROSHU7S2AKR1Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 7 May 2024','I brought this format plants good growth','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(1938,4,'Best for plant','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R239B4YSKHVCOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 10 March 2024','It\'s really good','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(1939,1,'Appears to city waste compost Not vermi compost','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2MBM6RVGB21B5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 21 June 2024','Please do not from this supplier, It do not appear to be vermi compost at all.

These are1. 1 transplanter2. 1 trowel3. 1 fork or weeder4. 1 rake5. 1 flower clipper6. 1 stem/twig clipper or pruner#1 - #5 seem to be of good quality.The wrought iron (or so it seems) part of these implements is sturdy and didn\'t appear to have any defects. Will post an update if these start rusting - no such signs thus far. The handles are made of good quality hard plastic and the joints well attached (at least so far).#6 is where the quality starts to deteriorate. The pruner has good quality metal clippers but the handles (and the spring holding them together) feels so light and delicate that you feel it will come apart at the slightest touch. There is a lock to prevent it from springing apart which works quite well though.- There is a pair of gardening gloves that are, again, not the best quality and came a bit stuck together - possibly melted owing to the hot weather. This doesn\'t quite augur well for one hasn\'t bought this for one season but for a few!- 1 packet of seeds - we got those of the Zinnia plant,  not sure if this is consistent across all packages.Finally, the container box to hold all items is quite a disappointment. While it has a handy notch at one end that aids easy handling and movement it is the flimsiest item of the lot. The lid doesn\'t close properly and the plastic itself is a bit misshapen and bends far too easily. Not sure how long it will hold up.

The 2nd meter is the light meter which is for me very beneficial because I have a lot of indor plants and now I can keep a check on how much light my plants are receiving and can adjust them accordingly the 3rd one and the most important for me is the PH level meter it will show you if the soil is alkaline or acid is nature and if you\'re plants are not growing properly and if they are dying even though they are receiving proper sunlight and water than my friend it because of the soil in which you have kept them and the PH meter helps you in understanding if the soil is good for plants or not and you can add fertilizers or change the soil accordingly.I bought this mainly for my Alocasia which leaves were drying even though it used to receive proper sunlight (which the plant requires to grow) and also the watering was correct but because of the soil being acidic in nature the plant was unable to grow properly and the leaves were drying and with the help of the meter I could make the changes accordingly and now my Alocasia is doing amazing...Even tried the meter with my other plants like monstera, snake plant, lemon.....(can\'t name all I have around 70 of them)It\'s worth every single penny.','True','B07BFVM59Z','POSITIVE'),(2033,2,'Moisture meter','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R38TNBRXVCAENA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 11 May 2024','The media could not be loaded.\n                Quality issues , Light meter does not work properly','True','B07BFVM59Z','NEGATIVE'),(2034,3,'So So','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1HAVFSSUG25PL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 19 May 2024','Its lying in Almira','True','B07BFVM59Z','NEUTRAL'),(2035,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R289Q7UVNAHNE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 21 March 2024','Discover the transformative power of this product – it\'s not just about how much water your plant receives, but about the flourishing difference it makes in your plant\'s life.

This 5kg block of 100% natural coconut fiber expands up to 25 liters each, making it a highly economical and versatile option.One of the key advantages of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its ability to improve soil structure and water retention. Coconut fiber is renowned for its exceptional water-holding capacity, which helps to prevent soil from drying out too quickly and ensures plants have a consistent supply of moisture. This is particularly beneficial for potted plants, which can often struggle with drainage and moisture issues in traditional potting mixes.In addition to its water-retaining properties, the cocopeat block is also rich in organic matter and essential nutrients that are crucial for healthy plant growth. The natural fibers help to aerate the soil, improving oxygen flow to plant roots and promoting the development of strong, vibrant foliage. The inclusion of enriched potting soil mix further enhances the nutrient content, providing plants with a well-balanced foundation for optimal growth.One of the standout features of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its versatility. The compact block can be easily broken down and mixed into existing soil or used as a standalone potting mix, making it suitable for a wide range of plant types, from delicate seedlings to established shrubs and trees. The natural, chemical-free composition also makes it an excellent choice for organic gardeners who prefer to avoid synthetic fertilizers and soil amendments.Another notable aspect of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its durability and longevity. Unlike some soil amendments that can break down quickly, the coconut fiber maintains its structure and benefits over time, ensuring your plants continue to thrive season after season.

Perfect for professional use.Eventhough the product is excellent still many users are reviewing it to negative as far as leakage is concerned. It is because of the ignorance while assembling the extension pipe provided in the pack. Manufacturer has given several O ring rubber washers in a separate pouch but it seems most of the buyers are  manifesting that as a mere additional accessory which may not be useful for its regular use.But it is totally wrong.There is a cap provided in the pack for attaching the extension pipe with the water injector module .It has to be tightened after inserting the O ring washer in between. Otherwise water leakage from the joint is a most probable outcome.Once the washer is attached the unit will perform flawless.Perhaps a common user may not recognize the importance of  an O ring washer in  water supply.It can be visible in our home plumbing .From a wash basin to an electric geyser the role of washers are not so least.Even the jaguar Taps will start to leak between the tap and the tube connecting to the mains line  without an O ring .This product deserves nothing less than 5 stars and those who gave less than 5 stars for reasons other than leakage have overlooked the product.Since it is a pressure sprayer designed for  watering and spraying pesticides to plants and not  to replace any pressure wash for cleaning cars or algae. Every product is expected to perform some function and never discontent with that only because it is not performing some other function.This is purely a manual pressure sprayer designed to sprinkle pesticide or water at a nominal pressure and for the same purpose 120 or 140 bar is not at all required.It cannot be used to clean vehicle as the pressure is not at all sufficient for self cleaning without wiping.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(2047,4,'Intended for Rooftop gardeners','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2VT3423H73H3D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 28 August 2022','If you have 150-200 pots to feed liquid nutrients, this is the best option for you. But for 600 pot owners, I would suggest a full 16 litre sprayer. I have to feed at least 9-10 litres of liquid to my plants time to time, so I preferred this 8 litre sprayer, which is light weight and easy to carry. Kissankraft sprayer comes with two types of carrying system. One can hang it from soldier by strap or can carry by handle. I prefer the second one. The pumper has a locking system and locked pumper becomes carrying handle. The sprayer nozzle and pipe can cover 5 feet radius, so positioning it nearby a set of pots, drenching them and carrying it in another spot is less tiresome than all time carrying it by strap.Pumper is very easy going. At least 30-32 push is necessary in a set and you have to repeat it a few times to spray full 8 litre. Nozzle rod is made of plastic, light weight and sturdy. Same is true for the body parts.There is a convenient pressure release valve and a sprayer push lock to continue spraying without a fatigued finger.I found many reviews complaining about leakage although did not experienced any. I did not used spare valves provided with it, just tightened parts before using, and it working fine. Flow is flawless.Only negative side is, this pumper does not comes with an extended base. So best keep it for rooftop gardening. If one has a small kitchen garden in backyard with jagged land it would be difficult to keep pumper in upright position while spraying.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(2048,5,'Superb/ multipurpose/ effecient','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R19N7XDS7AWCBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 10 August 2021','Uses1.

My bike (Unicorn 150) and Scooter (Jupiter 125-19 Features more than Latest Activas) gets too much dust. The day I received this Kisan Kraft 8 liter manual sprayer, I was very happy and surprised that in just 8 liter of water, I can clean my bike completely by self and avoid standing in queue at washing station. My only regret is, I should have ordered it years ago (LOL I didn\'t knew when this product entered market). Just fill 8 liter of water and pump 20 times. If you feel pressure is not good then pump again few more times and spray clean. Repeat the cycle until water is no more. For me it takes 3 cycle of 20 times pump. I first adjust the nozzle to sprinkle and wet my bike. Wait for 5 min. Then I adjust the nozzle to thin water pressure to pressure wash my bike. Some times I first sprinkle water and then take a coir brush and shampoo (Sunsilk Rs. 1 packet) and rub over my bike. Then I pressure wash. That\'s all in 8 liter of water. Its almost a miracle. Amazing product!!!This Rs. 1000 product could literally save many thousands.I also washed the outdoor and indoor unit of my AC and my god I never imagined the amount of dust was in there. My entire floor was almost black as the dust got mixed with water. That was crazy. Now even at 29c + Ceiling fan at medium speed, my AC gives hill station feeling in Summer. Again Amazing manual pressure washer!!!Bonus tips:1. After using, untight the handle in by 10% to prevent damage to the rubber O ring. If you ask why, answer is, if product is not in use and you screw it tightly then the rubber O rings may damage being subjected to constant pressure.2. Sprinkle with nozzle just 1cm away from the fins when cleaning AC\'s internal unit.3. Use sprinkle to clean mosquito net.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(2053,2,'Sprayer not functioning within 15 days of purchase','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R23K2XV8G4XBR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 16 March 2024','It\'s a china productNo issuesBut the sprayer is not working properlyCalled customer care but no proper responseEmailed alsoGot the numbers of the service person inumbaiBut still no parts reached or deliveredVery sad to buy this product','True','B01AUPGA9Y','NEGATIVE'),(2054,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R9S8EEDAL38HD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 3 January 2024','Nice','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(2055,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RZHBYQIBQYNW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 16 December 2023','Good','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(2056,5,'Excellent quality.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RI9FLMTFYIQJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 20 May 2024','It’s 100% pure; no adulteration.','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(2057,4,'No positive result is seen.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RAY6SN84HW0M3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 27 May 2024','I purchased this product for myroof top garden but no improvement is seen after using this.','True','B07XP89S1Z','NEGATIVE'),(2058,5,'It\'s Very much Useful for Plants to avoid Fungus to spoil Plante.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RJW872UH92UQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 1 July 2024','For Compost n it is Easy to Use also.It Provides Nutrition to   also.','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(2059,3,'Didn\'t like it','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3BC4AMM1V81T6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 5 January 2024','The neem powder when exposed to water covers with fungus type of substance, not sure how good this is for the plants as some plants don\'t react very well when this is put, I still see ants and spider around the plants, there is that neem smell to the product, so maybe this is genuine and not some black crap.','True','B07XP89S1Z','NEGATIVE'),(2060,5,'Very useful product for garden','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2M4ZSTIIWFBLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 6 May 2024','It\'s great valuable product','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(2061,4,'It\'s okay','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2IS117A2K86A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 14 May 2023','It does work well, but it might be a bit over-priced, hence giving it one star less.

My experience with your cocopeat is a mixed one. my experience with the earlier order was very good. But with this order it is of disapointment. I shall try to explain. The consistency of the earlier supply of cocopeat was a little coarse (not powdery). being a coarse medium, the roots of Microgreens that I grow, could easily breath (yes the roots breath too). Where as the supply I got through this order turned out to be very powdery in consistency. This causes lots of avoidable complications. For instance, the medium tend to stick to the surfaces of the container. also due to very dense consistency, the roots  find it difficult to breath. My suggestion to Ugaoo would be to grade the cocopeat as \"coarse\" and \"fine\" and let your customer decide the grade he / she wants to buy.','True','B0BRSS1PXY','NEGATIVE'),(2217,5,'Thank you so much','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R378STYN17P72Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRSS1PXY','Reviewed in India on 11 July 2024','My mom is very happy with this for her pots at home, and we will be ordering more, thank you!','True','B0BRSS1PXY','POSITIVE'),(2218,5,'Excellent product, my plant are flowering too much after using the.

It will not easily snap off unless you pull it apart. I also like that it has a very soft feel so it won’t damage the stems. You can also very easily adjust it to allow for expansion or growth in the future. I would suggest using a longer piece to allow for adjustments later as needed. Definitely glad I found this product.

While it does its job effectively, it\'s hard to justify the relatively high cost, especially when there are more affordable options available in the market.Secondly, my main gripe with this product is the branding. The company has prominently displayed their branding on the wire organizer, and this branding is clearly visible when you use it for your plants. Personally, I prefer my plants to look clean and tidy without any external branding interfering with their natural beauty. After all, I\'m the one who nurtured and cared for these plants; the branding doesn\'t represent their origin or care. Furthermore, the branding is in white color, making it even more noticeable.Because of these drawbacks, I have decided to give this product three stars.

I have to really \'pull\' the cord to start it. I see that the machine runs for over one and a half hr with one liter petrol while cutting grass/shrub mixed lot at half throttle. The arrangement provided as the throttle stop is  convenient for this purpose, though it would have been more convenient if the rpm/power could be further reduced with the same set up. Full throttle will be too powerful for grass cutting, I think. The worst part is that the entire weight of the handle/shaft/flexible shaft is to be taken in the hands while the engine rests conveniently on the back. I don\'t believe anyone can use this backpack machine for more than an hr non-stop! The natural position for cutting comes a bit stooping (unless he is short) and that will tell on your back.  If one adjusts the handle to balance the handle weight, he will end up too near the cutting blade/wheel and his body bent too far; and if he adjusts the handle-grip to keep a safe distance it will weigh down on his arms! That is what is really troubling me. I am afraid I\'m going to have to buy a sidepack as this backpack has failed my expectation.Edit after a few more hours of operation: Now the engine has started stalling after operating for a while, every time. Start it, use it for 15-20 minutes  and the engine stutters and stops. And I have used the machine only for about 9-10 hours in all. A much cheaper Chinese machine would do better than this, I suppose.

When I finally did:1. The product arrived one day before due date.2. It was impeccably packed.3. Each count was correct - including the manual. This is a little difficult to locate as it’s only a small card, printed on reverse of the packing slip. I also received the 20 extra red  sprinklers as promised.4. Installation was fairly easy - though it was done largely by a friend who is good with plumbing and repairs.5. The item quality turned out to be very, very good. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️6. There were leakages at a couple of points where we had inserted the winged connectors in main line.  These were fixed easily with a bit of twisting and some m-seal.But all things are not perfect. The red sprinklers can be regulated to some extent - but not like the shower in your bathroom. They keep dribbling or overshooting. However, we found a good use for these and snuck them between two half round pots, thus serving both pots with one pipe. See picThe black drippers can be unscrewed for cleaning - but you can’t stop them from dripping. So don’t try.Tips:1. Don’t start off cutting this into pieces straightaway. Fit and test one line before taking up the rest.2. Draw a rough plan of how the layout will be, where do you need T connectors and elbow bends and where all you need to regulate or stop the flow of water.3. If possible don’t use the tap connector supplied by Cingaro to connect the system to main tap. Use a soft hose pipe and a clamp for this. See pic.4. Fixing the winged t connectors into the 4 mm pipe is a nightmare with bare hands. Your thumb and fingers will get sore in half an hour. Soften the end of the 4 mm pipe by heating it slightly, and use a gardening glove to twist the t in. Remember that the slanted end goes into the 16 mm pipe, straight end into the 4 mm pipe.5. You will need to figure out the time you need to leave this on by trial and error. A 9” plastic pot needs about 100-300 ml water. The drippers are rated for 1 litre per hour. So if you leave the system on for about 5-15 minutes, your plants will get enough water.6. If you have small and large pots, you can order other types of drippers separately and use them on the same line. Green ones are rated at 2 litres per hour.7. If you want to fit it and forget it, you will have to order a timer valve. You can get a multi outlet timer valve also, if you want separate times and setting for leafy and flowering plants.Because the system is so flexible, it will very nearly do everything you ask it to do. Except plucking the flowers!

The system does not require a high flow rate/pressure. I connect it to my main water line at flow rate of about 1l/min and it works without hassles. The loosest fit is the dripper which is at risk to come loose if high water pressure is used.Adjustability : This I would consider somewhat of a con in that it\'s not a drip irrigation. The flow rate at the slowest from the dripper is at around 49ml/min, which is quite high. So within 10mins u will have watered about 500ml . Further there is no option to turn off the dripper. To stop flow u need to unplug the dripper and block the 4mm pipe.Appearance: Quite aesthetic looking if u route the main supply pipe properly. My suggestion here would be to place the main pipe (16mm) at a higher level and the 4mm pipe to be connected along the bottom to go downwards. (Have ordered more main pipe and will post photos once my system is set)Value for money: definitely as at ₹500-600 for 30 plants, u can just turn on the mains and forget it for the time u want to water.(else u lose around 1/2 hr watering each plant individially) If u use an irrigation timer even this much attention will not be required.To sum up:Pros:Works as advertisedFit it and forget it - hence time savingDoesn\'t require much water pressure.Cons:Dripper fitting is on the looser sideSlowest drip rate is ~50ml/minNo option to turn the dripper off.Suggestions:Use sprinkler type end drippers along with these drip ones if u need to cover a wider ground area(e.g. in gardens where u might have a mix of plants growing on the ground and in pots)','True','B07GMVDTH1','POSITIVE'),(2665,5,'Excellent Quality Product','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1GSP86SWA522C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07GMVDTH1','Reviewed in India on 18 May 2024','The media could not be loaded.\n                My name Dhananjay Singh, I ordered this drip irrigation system for our Dhyan Ashram\'s small phoolwadi, The quality of the product is very good, the fitting, adjustability is good.

Package was intact and what we have to do with that as many customers complain. I must admit the product is made up of gud quality plastic and looks durable too. There is no leakage issues because of proper usage of rubber washers. I too felt little issues with water refilling but the manual guides u well. There is nothing wrong with it because of less grip on upper inside of funnel it look difficult to dissemble. Instead of opening it from top anticlockwise you go from bottom side CLOCKWISE. That will surely resolve the issue.

Not stainless steel and not acceptable. Beware the blade will get rusted and then it won\'t be usable. Rusting images attached.CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIAL QUALITY: (Serious problem)The chrome plating was getting off exposing rust on tin metal caps over wooden handles. Disappointed ⚠️The plastic bumper shock absorbers are a failed design. Tiny plastic caps are plugged on metal handle frame which is flimsy and wobbly. Will definitely break over use and when it will break the scissors will pass through making it unusable. SERIOUS PROBLEMThe blades are said  to be Vanadium stainless steel but IT GETS RUSTED even after taking care within 2 months. The blades are at 26cm (usable length is 21cm) and thickness is 0.3mm.The blades are riveted strongly with metal handle bars which in turn is firmly fixed with wooden handles.Also there is this yellow hand held knob that makes it easy to tighten or loosen the sheer.Sturdiness is excellent.CUTTING PERFORMANCE:The 0.3mm thick super sharp blades can cut from paper to thick branches. It can easily cut through thick bushes, hard twigs, thick branches.

It gives an immediate feeling of losing the leverage and may be the need for more pressure. However i was pleasantly surprised with its pruning ability. Its flawless. The strength and sharpness of the steel blade is precise and its cuts through with similar pressure required in other pruners. What it lacks in leverage it compensates on sharpness, strength and the USP of having no spring. Its sheer German quality. But its grossly overpriced and the seller needs to consider the pricing post GST. Please check from other sources if there is a price drop before hitting the buy.

It has rechargeable Li battery and is very convenient and easy to use. The size is appropriate for home gardeners. And the pressure lasts till the end. Also, no requirement of manual pumping is a big relief!The battery charged quite fast. How long the battery shall recharge  will be known only after use for a few months.There were 2 big washers and a c-Type cable and long spout as accessories. However, it is the small rubber washer used with the small spout that breaks since that is the part which is moved to set the size of the spray. Spares for the small washer should be included (see 2nd pic).

The product is very good. Initially, you might get overwhelmed seeing the plethora of attachments provided but it is quite easy to figure out. You might not need every attachment, the seller has provided them in case you need them - for people who are setting it up in bigger gardens.The main pipe is quite long and I guess you can make more holes and water more than 32 plants if you are setting it up in a balcony or plants are close by. You can also buy additional accessories from the official site to expand the set up.However, some of the joints can leak little water, use m-seal and fix them up. In my case only one joint leaked, maybe because the hole i punched was not proper.Special bonus points to the seller - I had some issues regarding some attachments and contacted the seller (you can get the whatsapp number from official site) and he was very polite, solved my issues promptly.

I bought it to maintain my plants and give them a regular shower, but I am deeply disapointed by the quality and function of it. Here is my reason why:- the handle is really instable and weak for a fully filled (2L) bottle, the entire gun (spray/pump/handle) unit is low quality and super cheaply produced. The handle bends under the weight, which confirms predecessing reviewers.- the pump shaft is not tight and rather loosely put into the gun unit; hence wobbling around, which makes it prone for breaking the unit sooner or later as it introduces an angle to the pump shaft. Every engineer will cnfirm those physics.- the adjustable nozzle is of poor quality. It is half metal, half plastic. If you dont tight up the lower plasic part the bottle will just release water and pressure without even touching the trigger. The metal part is borderline to fall apart when setting it to a mist sparey setting in oppose to a straight beam of water. You twist ti a millimeter too far, it comes off. If you twisst it a millimeter too less, its no mist spray any more- the biggest disappointment is however the way it is designed to process the water. That indeed is a design failure as you cannot use the spray bottle in an angle if your water level falls below 1L. Reason is, the internal feeder pipe will then be outside the water level and just suck up the airpressure rather than the water. It only works if you keep the bottle in a perfect vertical, leveled position. Which in effect defeats the entire purpose of that spray bottle.On a side note, you cannot use the bottle upside down. Ok, that was not mentioned in the product description, but I guess you should know, especially if you have a little sophistication in gardening.Thus please save your cash and spend it on a different product.

Also it holds the water content so the soil remains wet and you don\'t have to water your plants unless it is a sunny day or high temperature is maintained. Sometimes it was observed that after watering the plants, the texture of the soil get ruined but not with this one.The fertility of this soil is good, seeds gets easily germinated. You don\'t have to feed your plants with fertilizer for 1 month after potting this soil because it is well formed soil and have fertilizer already added in it with other necessary contents.Conclusion: although the price is high because locally you can purchase more soil at the same price rate but this potting soil from trustbasket have all the necessary nutrients which are needed by your plants in order to grow and develop themselves so the price gets justified.

Every time I call they just send an automated message saying \"I will call you right back\" but I never receive a call back.Due to their such behavior I feel they are just importing some cheap disposable type Chinese machines & sell online with \"Sell & Forget\" policy by pushing up the buyers\' ratings by offering extended warranty if the buyer gives their 4+ rating.

This means that individual results may vary, depending on the user\'s strength and technique.Additionally I have found that the hand grip of the cutter to be quiet uncomfortable when cutting larger branches. The grip is made of foam, which can make it challenging to maintain a frim hold during prolonged use.The major concern I have Is safety lock of the cutter, as it broken within 2 months of use.

They are an excellent choice for environmentally conscious gardeners and farmers. Here are some common types of organic fertilizers and their benefits:Compost:Source: Decomposed organic matter, such as kitchen scraps, yard waste, and manure.Benefits: Rich in organic matter, compost improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a balanced range of nutrients. It enhances microbial activity in the soil.Manure:Source: Animal waste, such as cow, chicken, or horse manure.Benefits: A good source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Manure also adds organic matter to the soil and helps improve soil fertility.Bone Meal:Source: Ground bones, usually from cattle.Benefits: High in phosphorus, bone meal is beneficial for flowering and fruiting plants. It contributes to root development and overall plant strength.Fish Emulsion:Source: Fish waste and remains.Benefits: Provides a quick source of nitrogen, as well as phosphorus and potassium. It is often used as a liquid fertilizer and promotes vigorous plant growth.Blood Meal:Source: Dried and powdered animal blood, usually from cattle.Benefits: High in nitrogen, blood meal is excellent for promoting leafy green growth in plants. It\'s a fast-acting organic fertilizer.Seaweed/Kelp Fertilizer:Source: Extracts from seaweed or kelp.Benefits: Rich in trace minerals, seaweed fertilizer enhances plant growth, improves stress resistance, and promotes overall plant health.Cover Crops:Source: Various plants grown to cover and protect the soil.Benefits: Leguminous cover crops, like clover, add nitrogen to the soil through a process called nitrogen fixation. Cover crops also prevent erosion and improve soil fertility.Green Manure:Source: Plants, such as legumes, that are grown and then plowed back into the soil.Benefits: Adds organic matter, improves soil structure, and releases nutrients as it decomposes.When using organic fertilizers, it\'s important to note that they release nutrients more slowly compared to synthetic fertilizers. Patience is key, as organic fertilizers contribute to long-term soil health and sustainability. Additionally, the choice of organic fertilizer may depend on the specific nutrient needs of the plants and the soil conditions. Always follow recommended application rates to avoid over-fertilizing.','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(3579,3,'Fertiliser is not good for plants','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1MIVWVPW0BG2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 8 July 2024','Waste of money.','True','B08D8CHZ9C','NEGATIVE'),(3580,5,'It\'s good for growth of my plant','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/ROSHU7S2AKR1Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 7 May 2024','I brought this format plants good growth','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(3581,4,'Best for plant','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R239B4YSKHVCOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 10 March 2024','It\'s really good','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(3582,1,'Appears to city waste compost Not vermi compost','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2MBM6RVGB21B5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 21 June 2024','Please do not from this supplier, It do not appear to be vermi compost at all.

These are1. 1 transplanter2. 1 trowel3. 1 fork or weeder4. 1 rake5. 1 flower clipper6. 1 stem/twig clipper or pruner#1 - #5 seem to be of good quality.The wrought iron (or so it seems) part of these implements is sturdy and didn\'t appear to have any defects. Will post an update if these start rusting - no such signs thus far. The handles are made of good quality hard plastic and the joints well attached (at least so far).#6 is where the quality starts to deteriorate. The pruner has good quality metal clippers but the handles (and the spring holding them together) feels so light and delicate that you feel it will come apart at the slightest touch. There is a lock to prevent it from springing apart which works quite well though.- There is a pair of gardening gloves that are, again, not the best quality and came a bit stuck together - possibly melted owing to the hot weather. This doesn\'t quite augur well for one hasn\'t bought this for one season but for a few!- 1 packet of seeds - we got those of the Zinnia plant,  not sure if this is consistent across all packages.Finally, the container box to hold all items is quite a disappointment. While it has a handy notch at one end that aids easy handling and movement it is the flimsiest item of the lot. The lid doesn\'t close properly and the plastic itself is a bit misshapen and bends far too easily. Not sure how long it will hold up.

The 2nd meter is the light meter which is for me very beneficial because I have a lot of indor plants and now I can keep a check on how much light my plants are receiving and can adjust them accordingly the 3rd one and the most important for me is the PH level meter it will show you if the soil is alkaline or acid is nature and if you\'re plants are not growing properly and if they are dying even though they are receiving proper sunlight and water than my friend it because of the soil in which you have kept them and the PH meter helps you in understanding if the soil is good for plants or not and you can add fertilizers or change the soil accordingly.I bought this mainly for my Alocasia which leaves were drying even though it used to receive proper sunlight (which the plant requires to grow) and also the watering was correct but because of the soil being acidic in nature the plant was unable to grow properly and the leaves were drying and with the help of the meter I could make the changes accordingly and now my Alocasia is doing amazing...Even tried the meter with my other plants like monstera, snake plant, lemon.....(can\'t name all I have around 70 of them)It\'s worth every single penny.','True','B07BFVM59Z','POSITIVE'),(3676,2,'Moisture meter','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R38TNBRXVCAENA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 11 May 2024','The media could not be loaded.\n                Quality issues , Light meter does not work properly','True','B07BFVM59Z','NEGATIVE'),(3677,3,'So So','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1HAVFSSUG25PL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 19 May 2024','Its lying in Almira','True','B07BFVM59Z','NEUTRAL'),(3678,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R289Q7UVNAHNE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 21 March 2024','Discover the transformative power of this product – it\'s not just about how much water your plant receives, but about the flourishing difference it makes in your plant\'s life.

This 5kg block of 100% natural coconut fiber expands up to 25 liters each, making it a highly economical and versatile option.One of the key advantages of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its ability to improve soil structure and water retention. Coconut fiber is renowned for its exceptional water-holding capacity, which helps to prevent soil from drying out too quickly and ensures plants have a consistent supply of moisture. This is particularly beneficial for potted plants, which can often struggle with drainage and moisture issues in traditional potting mixes.In addition to its water-retaining properties, the cocopeat block is also rich in organic matter and essential nutrients that are crucial for healthy plant growth. The natural fibers help to aerate the soil, improving oxygen flow to plant roots and promoting the development of strong, vibrant foliage. The inclusion of enriched potting soil mix further enhances the nutrient content, providing plants with a well-balanced foundation for optimal growth.One of the standout features of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its versatility. The compact block can be easily broken down and mixed into existing soil or used as a standalone potting mix, making it suitable for a wide range of plant types, from delicate seedlings to established shrubs and trees. The natural, chemical-free composition also makes it an excellent choice for organic gardeners who prefer to avoid synthetic fertilizers and soil amendments.Another notable aspect of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its durability and longevity. Unlike some soil amendments that can break down quickly, the coconut fiber maintains its structure and benefits over time, ensuring your plants continue to thrive season after season.

Perfect for professional use.Eventhough the product is excellent still many users are reviewing it to negative as far as leakage is concerned. It is because of the ignorance while assembling the extension pipe provided in the pack. Manufacturer has given several O ring rubber washers in a separate pouch but it seems most of the buyers are  manifesting that as a mere additional accessory which may not be useful for its regular use.But it is totally wrong.There is a cap provided in the pack for attaching the extension pipe with the water injector module .It has to be tightened after inserting the O ring washer in between. Otherwise water leakage from the joint is a most probable outcome.Once the washer is attached the unit will perform flawless.Perhaps a common user may not recognize the importance of  an O ring washer in  water supply.It can be visible in our home plumbing .From a wash basin to an electric geyser the role of washers are not so least.Even the jaguar Taps will start to leak between the tap and the tube connecting to the mains line  without an O ring .This product deserves nothing less than 5 stars and those who gave less than 5 stars for reasons other than leakage have overlooked the product.Since it is a pressure sprayer designed for  watering and spraying pesticides to plants and not  to replace any pressure wash for cleaning cars or algae. Every product is expected to perform some function and never discontent with that only because it is not performing some other function.This is purely a manual pressure sprayer designed to sprinkle pesticide or water at a nominal pressure and for the same purpose 120 or 140 bar is not at all required.It cannot be used to clean vehicle as the pressure is not at all sufficient for self cleaning without wiping.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(3690,4,'Intended for Rooftop gardeners','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2VT3423H73H3D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 28 August 2022','If you have 150-200 pots to feed liquid nutrients, this is the best option for you. But for 600 pot owners, I would suggest a full 16 litre sprayer. I have to feed at least 9-10 litres of liquid to my plants time to time, so I preferred this 8 litre sprayer, which is light weight and easy to carry. Kissankraft sprayer comes with two types of carrying system. One can hang it from soldier by strap or can carry by handle. I prefer the second one. The pumper has a locking system and locked pumper becomes carrying handle. The sprayer nozzle and pipe can cover 5 feet radius, so positioning it nearby a set of pots, drenching them and carrying it in another spot is less tiresome than all time carrying it by strap.Pumper is very easy going. At least 30-32 push is necessary in a set and you have to repeat it a few times to spray full 8 litre. Nozzle rod is made of plastic, light weight and sturdy. Same is true for the body parts.There is a convenient pressure release valve and a sprayer push lock to continue spraying without a fatigued finger.I found many reviews complaining about leakage although did not experienced any. I did not used spare valves provided with it, just tightened parts before using, and it working fine. Flow is flawless.Only negative side is, this pumper does not comes with an extended base. So best keep it for rooftop gardening. If one has a small kitchen garden in backyard with jagged land it would be difficult to keep pumper in upright position while spraying.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(3691,5,'Superb/ multipurpose/ effecient','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R19N7XDS7AWCBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 10 August 2021','Uses1.

My bike (Unicorn 150) and Scooter (Jupiter 125-19 Features more than Latest Activas) gets too much dust. The day I received this Kisan Kraft 8 liter manual sprayer, I was very happy and surprised that in just 8 liter of water, I can clean my bike completely by self and avoid standing in queue at washing station. My only regret is, I should have ordered it years ago (LOL I didn\'t knew when this product entered market). Just fill 8 liter of water and pump 20 times. If you feel pressure is not good then pump again few more times and spray clean. Repeat the cycle until water is no more. For me it takes 3 cycle of 20 times pump. I first adjust the nozzle to sprinkle and wet my bike. Wait for 5 min. Then I adjust the nozzle to thin water pressure to pressure wash my bike. Some times I first sprinkle water and then take a coir brush and shampoo (Sunsilk Rs. 1 packet) and rub over my bike. Then I pressure wash. That\'s all in 8 liter of water. Its almost a miracle. Amazing product!!!This Rs. 1000 product could literally save many thousands.I also washed the outdoor and indoor unit of my AC and my god I never imagined the amount of dust was in there. My entire floor was almost black as the dust got mixed with water. That was crazy. Now even at 29c + Ceiling fan at medium speed, my AC gives hill station feeling in Summer. Again Amazing manual pressure washer!!!Bonus tips:1. After using, untight the handle in by 10% to prevent damage to the rubber O ring. If you ask why, answer is, if product is not in use and you screw it tightly then the rubber O rings may damage being subjected to constant pressure.2. Sprinkle with nozzle just 1cm away from the fins when cleaning AC\'s internal unit.3. Use sprinkle to clean mosquito net.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(3696,2,'Sprayer not functioning within 15 days of purchase','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R23K2XV8G4XBR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 16 March 2024','It\'s a china productNo issuesBut the sprayer is not working properlyCalled customer care but no proper responseEmailed alsoGot the numbers of the service person inumbaiBut still no parts reached or deliveredVery sad to buy this product','True','B01AUPGA9Y','NEGATIVE'),(3697,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R9S8EEDAL38HD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 3 January 2024','Nice','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(3698,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RZHBYQIBQYNW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 16 December 2023','Good','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(3699,5,'Excellent quality.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RI9FLMTFYIQJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 20 May 2024','It’s 100% pure; no adulteration.','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(3700,4,'No positive result is seen.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RAY6SN84HW0M3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 27 May 2024','I purchased this product for myroof top garden but no improvement is seen after using this.','True','B07XP89S1Z','NEGATIVE'),(3701,5,'It\'s Very much Useful for Plants to avoid Fungus to spoil Plante.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RJW872UH92UQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 1 July 2024','For Compost n it is Easy to Use also.It Provides Nutrition to   also.','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(3702,3,'Didn\'t like it','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3BC4AMM1V81T6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 5 January 2024','The neem powder when exposed to water covers with fungus type of substance, not sure how good this is for the plants as some plants don\'t react very well when this is put, I still see ants and spider around the plants, there is that neem smell to the product, so maybe this is genuine and not some black crap.','True','B07XP89S1Z','NEGATIVE'),(3703,5,'Very useful product for garden','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2M4ZSTIIWFBLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 6 May 2024','It\'s great valuable product','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(3704,4,'It\'s okay','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2IS117A2K86A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 14 May 2023','It does work well, but it might be a bit over-priced, hence giving it one star less.

It has rechargeable Li battery and is very convenient and easy to use. The size is appropriate for home gardeners. And the pressure lasts till the end. Also, no requirement of manual pumping is a big relief!The battery charged quite fast. How long the battery shall recharge  will be known only after use for a few months.There were 2 big washers and a c-Type cable and long spout as accessories. However, it is the small rubber washer used with the small spout that breaks since that is the part which is moved to set the size of the spray. Spares for the small washer should be included (see 2nd pic). This is the only drawback in this otherwise excellent sprayer.','True','B0CYXB9KVV','POSITIVE'),(3859,5,'Wonderful performance','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RWO77L8QC6R0L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0CYXB9KVV','Reviewed in India on 4 June 2024','Dear BALWAAN,This is Fumitech Quarantine (INDIA) Pvt Ltd, and we are one of the leading pest control companies in Kerala rendering our services since 2005.

The product is very good. Initially, you might get overwhelmed seeing the plethora of attachments provided but it is quite easy to figure out. You might not need every attachment, the seller has provided them in case you need them - for people who are setting it up in bigger gardens.The main pipe is quite long and I guess you can make more holes and water more than 32 plants if you are setting it up in a balcony or plants are close by. You can also buy additional accessories from the official site to expand the set up.However, some of the joints can leak little water, use m-seal and fix them up. In my case only one joint leaked, maybe because the hole i punched was not proper.Special bonus points to the seller - I had some issues regarding some attachments and contacted the seller (you can get the whatsapp number from official site) and he was very polite, solved my issues promptly. So, I guess you can always contact him if you have problem setting up the system.

I bought it to maintain my plants and give them a regular shower, but I am deeply disapointed by the quality and function of it. Here is my reason why:- the handle is really instable and weak for a fully filled (2L) bottle, the entire gun (spray/pump/handle) unit is low quality and super cheaply produced. The handle bends under the weight, which confirms predecessing reviewers.- the pump shaft is not tight and rather loosely put into the gun unit; hence wobbling around, which makes it prone for breaking the unit sooner or later as it introduces an angle to the pump shaft. Every engineer will cnfirm those physics.- the adjustable nozzle is of poor quality. It is half metal, half plastic. If you dont tight up the lower plasic part the bottle will just release water and pressure without even touching the trigger. The metal part is borderline to fall apart when setting it to a mist sparey setting in oppose to a straight beam of water. You twist ti a millimeter too far, it comes off. If you twisst it a millimeter too less, its no mist spray any more- the biggest disappointment is however the way it is designed to process the water. That indeed is a design failure as you cannot use the spray bottle in an angle if your water level falls below 1L. Reason is, the internal feeder pipe will then be outside the water level and just suck up the airpressure rather than the water. It only works if you keep the bottle in a perfect vertical, leveled position. Which in effect defeats the entire purpose of that spray bottle.On a side note, you cannot use the bottle upside down. Ok, that was not mentioned in the product description, but I guess you should know, especially if you have a little sophistication in gardening.Thus please save your cash and spend it on a different product.

Also it holds the water content so the soil remains wet and you don\'t have to water your plants unless it is a sunny day or high temperature is maintained. Sometimes it was observed that after watering the plants, the texture of the soil get ruined but not with this one.The fertility of this soil is good, seeds gets easily germinated. You don\'t have to feed your plants with fertilizer for 1 month after potting this soil because it is well formed soil and have fertilizer already added in it with other necessary contents.Conclusion: although the price is high because locally you can purchase more soil at the same price rate but this potting soil from trustbasket have all the necessary nutrients which are needed by your plants in order to grow and develop themselves so the price gets justified.

Every time I call they just send an automated message saying \"I will call you right back\" but I never receive a call back.Due to their such behavior I feel they are just importing some cheap disposable type Chinese machines & sell online with \"Sell & Forget\" policy by pushing up the buyers\' ratings by offering extended warranty if the buyer gives their 4+ rating.

This means that individual results may vary, depending on the user\'s strength and technique.Additionally I have found that the hand grip of the cutter to be quiet uncomfortable when cutting larger branches. The grip is made of foam, which can make it challenging to maintain a frim hold during prolonged use.The major concern I have Is safety lock of the cutter, as it broken within 2 months of use.

They are an excellent choice for environmentally conscious gardeners and farmers. Here are some common types of organic fertilizers and their benefits:Compost:Source: Decomposed organic matter, such as kitchen scraps, yard waste, and manure.Benefits: Rich in organic matter, compost improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a balanced range of nutrients. It enhances microbial activity in the soil.Manure:Source: Animal waste, such as cow, chicken, or horse manure.Benefits: A good source of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Manure also adds organic matter to the soil and helps improve soil fertility.Bone Meal:Source: Ground bones, usually from cattle.Benefits: High in phosphorus, bone meal is beneficial for flowering and fruiting plants. It contributes to root development and overall plant strength.Fish Emulsion:Source: Fish waste and remains.Benefits: Provides a quick source of nitrogen, as well as phosphorus and potassium. It is often used as a liquid fertilizer and promotes vigorous plant growth.Blood Meal:Source: Dried and powdered animal blood, usually from cattle.Benefits: High in nitrogen, blood meal is excellent for promoting leafy green growth in plants. It\'s a fast-acting organic fertilizer.Seaweed/Kelp Fertilizer:Source: Extracts from seaweed or kelp.Benefits: Rich in trace minerals, seaweed fertilizer enhances plant growth, improves stress resistance, and promotes overall plant health.Cover Crops:Source: Various plants grown to cover and protect the soil.Benefits: Leguminous cover crops, like clover, add nitrogen to the soil through a process called nitrogen fixation. Cover crops also prevent erosion and improve soil fertility.Green Manure:Source: Plants, such as legumes, that are grown and then plowed back into the soil.Benefits: Adds organic matter, improves soil structure, and releases nutrients as it decomposes.When using organic fertilizers, it\'s important to note that they release nutrients more slowly compared to synthetic fertilizers. Patience is key, as organic fertilizers contribute to long-term soil health and sustainability. Additionally, the choice of organic fertilizer may depend on the specific nutrient needs of the plants and the soil conditions. Always follow recommended application rates to avoid over-fertilizing.','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(4097,3,'Fertiliser is not good for plants','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1MIVWVPW0BG2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 8 July 2024','Waste of money.','True','B08D8CHZ9C','NEGATIVE'),(4098,5,'It\'s good for growth of my plant','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/ROSHU7S2AKR1Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 7 May 2024','I brought this format plants good growth','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(4099,4,'Best for plant','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R239B4YSKHVCOK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 10 March 2024','It\'s really good','True','B08D8CHZ9C','POSITIVE'),(4100,1,'Appears to city waste compost Not vermi compost','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2MBM6RVGB21B5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B08D8CHZ9C','Reviewed in India on 21 June 2024','Please do not from this supplier, It do not appear to be vermi compost at all.

These are1. 1 transplanter2. 1 trowel3. 1 fork or weeder4. 1 rake5. 1 flower clipper6. 1 stem/twig clipper or pruner#1 - #5 seem to be of good quality.The wrought iron (or so it seems) part of these implements is sturdy and didn\'t appear to have any defects. Will post an update if these start rusting - no such signs thus far. The handles are made of good quality hard plastic and the joints well attached (at least so far).#6 is where the quality starts to deteriorate. The pruner has good quality metal clippers but the handles (and the spring holding them together) feels so light and delicate that you feel it will come apart at the slightest touch. There is a lock to prevent it from springing apart which works quite well though.- There is a pair of gardening gloves that are, again, not the best quality and came a bit stuck together - possibly melted owing to the hot weather. This doesn\'t quite augur well for one hasn\'t bought this for one season but for a few!- 1 packet of seeds - we got those of the Zinnia plant,  not sure if this is consistent across all packages.Finally, the container box to hold all items is quite a disappointment. While it has a handy notch at one end that aids easy handling and movement it is the flimsiest item of the lot. The lid doesn\'t close properly and the plastic itself is a bit misshapen and bends far too easily. Not sure how long it will hold up.

The 2nd meter is the light meter which is for me very beneficial because I have a lot of indor plants and now I can keep a check on how much light my plants are receiving and can adjust them accordingly the 3rd one and the most important for me is the PH level meter it will show you if the soil is alkaline or acid is nature and if you\'re plants are not growing properly and if they are dying even though they are receiving proper sunlight and water than my friend it because of the soil in which you have kept them and the PH meter helps you in understanding if the soil is good for plants or not and you can add fertilizers or change the soil accordingly.I bought this mainly for my Alocasia which leaves were drying even though it used to receive proper sunlight (which the plant requires to grow) and also the watering was correct but because of the soil being acidic in nature the plant was unable to grow properly and the leaves were drying and with the help of the meter I could make the changes accordingly and now my Alocasia is doing amazing...Even tried the meter with my other plants like monstera, snake plant, lemon.....(can\'t name all I have around 70 of them)It\'s worth every single penny.','True','B07BFVM59Z','POSITIVE'),(4194,2,'Moisture meter','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R38TNBRXVCAENA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 11 May 2024','The media could not be loaded.\n                Quality issues , Light meter does not work properly','True','B07BFVM59Z','NEGATIVE'),(4195,3,'So So','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1HAVFSSUG25PL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 19 May 2024','Its lying in Almira','True','B07BFVM59Z','NEUTRAL'),(4196,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R289Q7UVNAHNE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07BFVM59Z','Reviewed in India on 21 March 2024','Discover the transformative power of this product – it\'s not just about how much water your plant receives, but about the flourishing difference it makes in your plant\'s life.

This 5kg block of 100% natural coconut fiber expands up to 25 liters each, making it a highly economical and versatile option.One of the key advantages of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its ability to improve soil structure and water retention. Coconut fiber is renowned for its exceptional water-holding capacity, which helps to prevent soil from drying out too quickly and ensures plants have a consistent supply of moisture. This is particularly beneficial for potted plants, which can often struggle with drainage and moisture issues in traditional potting mixes.In addition to its water-retaining properties, the cocopeat block is also rich in organic matter and essential nutrients that are crucial for healthy plant growth. The natural fibers help to aerate the soil, improving oxygen flow to plant roots and promoting the development of strong, vibrant foliage. The inclusion of enriched potting soil mix further enhances the nutrient content, providing plants with a well-balanced foundation for optimal growth.One of the standout features of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its versatility. The compact block can be easily broken down and mixed into existing soil or used as a standalone potting mix, making it suitable for a wide range of plant types, from delicate seedlings to established shrubs and trees. The natural, chemical-free composition also makes it an excellent choice for organic gardeners who prefer to avoid synthetic fertilizers and soil amendments.Another notable aspect of the Kraft Seeds cocopeat is its durability and longevity. Unlike some soil amendments that can break down quickly, the coconut fiber maintains its structure and benefits over time, ensuring your plants continue to thrive season after season.

Perfect for professional use.Eventhough the product is excellent still many users are reviewing it to negative as far as leakage is concerned. It is because of the ignorance while assembling the extension pipe provided in the pack. Manufacturer has given several O ring rubber washers in a separate pouch but it seems most of the buyers are  manifesting that as a mere additional accessory which may not be useful for its regular use.But it is totally wrong.There is a cap provided in the pack for attaching the extension pipe with the water injector module .It has to be tightened after inserting the O ring washer in between. Otherwise water leakage from the joint is a most probable outcome.Once the washer is attached the unit will perform flawless.Perhaps a common user may not recognize the importance of  an O ring washer in  water supply.It can be visible in our home plumbing .From a wash basin to an electric geyser the role of washers are not so least.Even the jaguar Taps will start to leak between the tap and the tube connecting to the mains line  without an O ring .This product deserves nothing less than 5 stars and those who gave less than 5 stars for reasons other than leakage have overlooked the product.Since it is a pressure sprayer designed for  watering and spraying pesticides to plants and not  to replace any pressure wash for cleaning cars or algae. Every product is expected to perform some function and never discontent with that only because it is not performing some other function.This is purely a manual pressure sprayer designed to sprinkle pesticide or water at a nominal pressure and for the same purpose 120 or 140 bar is not at all required.It cannot be used to clean vehicle as the pressure is not at all sufficient for self cleaning without wiping.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(4208,4,'Intended for Rooftop gardeners','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2VT3423H73H3D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 28 August 2022','If you have 150-200 pots to feed liquid nutrients, this is the best option for you. But for 600 pot owners, I would suggest a full 16 litre sprayer. I have to feed at least 9-10 litres of liquid to my plants time to time, so I preferred this 8 litre sprayer, which is light weight and easy to carry. Kissankraft sprayer comes with two types of carrying system. One can hang it from soldier by strap or can carry by handle. I prefer the second one. The pumper has a locking system and locked pumper becomes carrying handle. The sprayer nozzle and pipe can cover 5 feet radius, so positioning it nearby a set of pots, drenching them and carrying it in another spot is less tiresome than all time carrying it by strap.Pumper is very easy going. At least 30-32 push is necessary in a set and you have to repeat it a few times to spray full 8 litre. Nozzle rod is made of plastic, light weight and sturdy. Same is true for the body parts.There is a convenient pressure release valve and a sprayer push lock to continue spraying without a fatigued finger.I found many reviews complaining about leakage although did not experienced any. I did not used spare valves provided with it, just tightened parts before using, and it working fine. Flow is flawless.Only negative side is, this pumper does not comes with an extended base. So best keep it for rooftop gardening. If one has a small kitchen garden in backyard with jagged land it would be difficult to keep pumper in upright position while spraying.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(4209,5,'Superb/ multipurpose/ effecient','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R19N7XDS7AWCBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 10 August 2021','Uses1.

My bike (Unicorn 150) and Scooter (Jupiter 125-19 Features more than Latest Activas) gets too much dust. The day I received this Kisan Kraft 8 liter manual sprayer, I was very happy and surprised that in just 8 liter of water, I can clean my bike completely by self and avoid standing in queue at washing station. My only regret is, I should have ordered it years ago (LOL I didn\'t knew when this product entered market). Just fill 8 liter of water and pump 20 times. If you feel pressure is not good then pump again few more times and spray clean. Repeat the cycle until water is no more. For me it takes 3 cycle of 20 times pump. I first adjust the nozzle to sprinkle and wet my bike. Wait for 5 min. Then I adjust the nozzle to thin water pressure to pressure wash my bike. Some times I first sprinkle water and then take a coir brush and shampoo (Sunsilk Rs. 1 packet) and rub over my bike. Then I pressure wash. That\'s all in 8 liter of water. Its almost a miracle. Amazing product!!!This Rs. 1000 product could literally save many thousands.I also washed the outdoor and indoor unit of my AC and my god I never imagined the amount of dust was in there. My entire floor was almost black as the dust got mixed with water. That was crazy. Now even at 29c + Ceiling fan at medium speed, my AC gives hill station feeling in Summer. Again Amazing manual pressure washer!!!Bonus tips:1. After using, untight the handle in by 10% to prevent damage to the rubber O ring. If you ask why, answer is, if product is not in use and you screw it tightly then the rubber O rings may damage being subjected to constant pressure.2. Sprinkle with nozzle just 1cm away from the fins when cleaning AC\'s internal unit.3. Use sprinkle to clean mosquito net.','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(4214,2,'Sprayer not functioning within 15 days of purchase','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R23K2XV8G4XBR1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 16 March 2024','It\'s a china productNo issuesBut the sprayer is not working properlyCalled customer care but no proper responseEmailed alsoGot the numbers of the service person inumbaiBut still no parts reached or deliveredVery sad to buy this product','True','B01AUPGA9Y','NEGATIVE'),(4215,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R9S8EEDAL38HD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 3 January 2024','Nice','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(4216,4,'Good','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RZHBYQIBQYNW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01AUPGA9Y','Reviewed in India on 16 December 2023','Good','True','B01AUPGA9Y','POSITIVE'),(4217,5,'Excellent quality.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RI9FLMTFYIQJZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 20 May 2024','It’s 100% pure; no adulteration.','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(4218,4,'No positive result is seen.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RAY6SN84HW0M3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 27 May 2024','I purchased this product for myroof top garden but no improvement is seen after using this.','True','B07XP89S1Z','NEGATIVE'),(4219,5,'It\'s Very much Useful for Plants to avoid Fungus to spoil Plante.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/RJW872UH92UQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 1 July 2024','For Compost n it is Easy to Use also.It Provides Nutrition to   also.','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(4220,3,'Didn\'t like it','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3BC4AMM1V81T6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 5 January 2024','The neem powder when exposed to water covers with fungus type of substance, not sure how good this is for the plants as some plants don\'t react very well when this is put, I still see ants and spider around the plants, there is that neem smell to the product, so maybe this is genuine and not some black crap.','True','B07XP89S1Z','NEGATIVE'),(4221,5,'Very useful product for garden','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2M4ZSTIIWFBLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 6 May 2024','It\'s great valuable product','True','B07XP89S1Z','POSITIVE'),(4222,4,'It\'s okay','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R2IS117A2K86A4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07XP89S1Z','Reviewed in India on 14 May 2023','It does work well, but it might be a bit over-priced, hence giving it one star less.

My experience with your cocopeat is a mixed one. my experience with the earlier order was very good. But with this order it is of disapointment. I shall try to explain. The consistency of the earlier supply of cocopeat was a little coarse (not powdery). being a coarse medium, the roots of Microgreens that I grow, could easily breath (yes the roots breath too). Where as the supply I got through this order turned out to be very powdery in consistency. This causes lots of avoidable complications. For instance, the medium tend to stick to the surfaces of the container. also due to very dense consistency, the roots  find it difficult to breath. My suggestion to Ugaoo would be to grade the cocopeat as \"coarse\" and \"fine\" and let your customer decide the grade he / she wants to buy.','True','B0BRSS1PXY','NEGATIVE'),(4378,5,'Thank you so much','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R378STYN17P72Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0BRSS1PXY','Reviewed in India on 11 July 2024','My mom is very happy with this for her pots at home, and we will be ordering more, thank you!','True','B0BRSS1PXY','POSITIVE'),(4379,5,'Excellent product, my plant are flowering too much after using the.

It will not easily snap off unless you pull it apart. I also like that it has a very soft feel so it won’t damage the stems. You can also very easily adjust it to allow for expansion or growth in the future. I would suggest using a longer piece to allow for adjustments later as needed. Definitely glad I found this product.

While it does its job effectively, it\'s hard to justify the relatively high cost, especially when there are more affordable options available in the market.Secondly, my main gripe with this product is the branding. The company has prominently displayed their branding on the wire organizer, and this branding is clearly visible when you use it for your plants. Personally, I prefer my plants to look clean and tidy without any external branding interfering with their natural beauty. After all, I\'m the one who nurtured and cared for these plants; the branding doesn\'t represent their origin or care. Furthermore, the branding is in white color, making it even more noticeable.Because of these drawbacks, I have decided to give this product three stars.

I have to really \'pull\' the cord to start it. I see that the machine runs for over one and a half hr with one liter petrol while cutting grass/shrub mixed lot at half throttle. The arrangement provided as the throttle stop is  convenient for this purpose, though it would have been more convenient if the rpm/power could be further reduced with the same set up. Full throttle will be too powerful for grass cutting, I think. The worst part is that the entire weight of the handle/shaft/flexible shaft is to be taken in the hands while the engine rests conveniently on the back. I don\'t believe anyone can use this backpack machine for more than an hr non-stop! The natural position for cutting comes a bit stooping (unless he is short) and that will tell on your back.  If one adjusts the handle to balance the handle weight, he will end up too near the cutting blade/wheel and his body bent too far; and if he adjusts the handle-grip to keep a safe distance it will weigh down on his arms! That is what is really troubling me. I am afraid I\'m going to have to buy a sidepack as this backpack has failed my expectation.Edit after a few more hours of operation: Now the engine has started stalling after operating for a while, every time. Start it, use it for 15-20 minutes  and the engine stutters and stops. And I have used the machine only for about 9-10 hours in all. A much cheaper Chinese machine would do better than this, I suppose.

When I finally did:1. The product arrived one day before due date.2. It was impeccably packed.3. Each count was correct - including the manual. This is a little difficult to locate as it’s only a small card, printed on reverse of the packing slip. I also received the 20 extra red  sprinklers as promised.4. Installation was fairly easy - though it was done largely by a friend who is good with plumbing and repairs.5. The item quality turned out to be very, very good. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️6. There were leakages at a couple of points where we had inserted the winged connectors in main line.  These were fixed easily with a bit of twisting and some m-seal.But all things are not perfect. The red sprinklers can be regulated to some extent - but not like the shower in your bathroom. They keep dribbling or overshooting. However, we found a good use for these and snuck them between two half round pots, thus serving both pots with one pipe. See picThe black drippers can be unscrewed for cleaning - but you can’t stop them from dripping. So don’t try.Tips:1. Don’t start off cutting this into pieces straightaway. Fit and test one line before taking up the rest.2. Draw a rough plan of how the layout will be, where do you need T connectors and elbow bends and where all you need to regulate or stop the flow of water.3. If possible don’t use the tap connector supplied by Cingaro to connect the system to main tap. Use a soft hose pipe and a clamp for this. See pic.4. Fixing the winged t connectors into the 4 mm pipe is a nightmare with bare hands. Your thumb and fingers will get sore in half an hour. Soften the end of the 4 mm pipe by heating it slightly, and use a gardening glove to twist the t in. Remember that the slanted end goes into the 16 mm pipe, straight end into the 4 mm pipe.5. You will need to figure out the time you need to leave this on by trial and error. A 9” plastic pot needs about 100-300 ml water. The drippers are rated for 1 litre per hour. So if you leave the system on for about 5-15 minutes, your plants will get enough water.6. If you have small and large pots, you can order other types of drippers separately and use them on the same line. Green ones are rated at 2 litres per hour.7. If you want to fit it and forget it, you will have to order a timer valve. You can get a multi outlet timer valve also, if you want separate times and setting for leafy and flowering plants.Because the system is so flexible, it will very nearly do everything you ask it to do. Except plucking the flowers!

The system does not require a high flow rate/pressure. I connect it to my main water line at flow rate of about 1l/min and it works without hassles. The loosest fit is the dripper which is at risk to come loose if high water pressure is used.Adjustability : This I would consider somewhat of a con in that it\'s not a drip irrigation. The flow rate at the slowest from the dripper is at around 49ml/min, which is quite high. So within 10mins u will have watered about 500ml . Further there is no option to turn off the dripper. To stop flow u need to unplug the dripper and block the 4mm pipe.Appearance: Quite aesthetic looking if u route the main supply pipe properly. My suggestion here would be to place the main pipe (16mm) at a higher level and the 4mm pipe to be connected along the bottom to go downwards. (Have ordered more main pipe and will post photos once my system is set)Value for money: definitely as at ₹500-600 for 30 plants, u can just turn on the mains and forget it for the time u want to water.(else u lose around 1/2 hr watering each plant individially) If u use an irrigation timer even this much attention will not be required.To sum up:Pros:Works as advertisedFit it and forget it - hence time savingDoesn\'t require much water pressure.Cons:Dripper fitting is on the looser sideSlowest drip rate is ~50ml/minNo option to turn the dripper off.Suggestions:Use sprinkler type end drippers along with these drip ones if u need to cover a wider ground area(e.g. in gardens where u might have a mix of plants growing on the ground and in pots)','True','B07GMVDTH1','POSITIVE'),(4826,5,'Excellent Quality Product','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R1GSP86SWA522C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07GMVDTH1','Reviewed in India on 18 May 2024','The media could not be loaded.\n                My name Dhananjay Singh, I ordered this drip irrigation system for our Dhyan Ashram\'s small phoolwadi, The quality of the product is very good, the fitting, adjustability is good.

Package was intact and what we have to do with that as many customers complain. I must admit the product is made up of gud quality plastic and looks durable too. There is no leakage issues because of proper usage of rubber washers. I too felt little issues with water refilling but the manual guides u well. There is nothing wrong with it because of less grip on upper inside of funnel it look difficult to dissemble. Instead of opening it from top anticlockwise you go from bottom side CLOCKWISE. That will surely resolve the issue.

Not stainless steel and not acceptable. Beware the blade will get rusted and then it won\'t be usable. Rusting images attached.CONSTRUCTION AND MATERIAL QUALITY: (Serious problem)The chrome plating was getting off exposing rust on tin metal caps over wooden handles. Disappointed ⚠️The plastic bumper shock absorbers are a failed design. Tiny plastic caps are plugged on metal handle frame which is flimsy and wobbly. Will definitely break over use and when it will break the scissors will pass through making it unusable. SERIOUS PROBLEMThe blades are said  to be Vanadium stainless steel but IT GETS RUSTED even after taking care within 2 months. The blades are at 26cm (usable length is 21cm) and thickness is 0.3mm.The blades are riveted strongly with metal handle bars which in turn is firmly fixed with wooden handles.Also there is this yellow hand held knob that makes it easy to tighten or loosen the sheer.Sturdiness is excellent.CUTTING PERFORMANCE:The 0.3mm thick super sharp blades can cut from paper to thick branches. It can easily cut through thick bushes, hard twigs, thick branches.

It gives an immediate feeling of losing the leverage and may be the need for more pressure. However i was pleasantly surprised with its pruning ability. Its flawless. The strength and sharpness of the steel blade is precise and its cuts through with similar pressure required in other pruners. What it lacks in leverage it compensates on sharpness, strength and the USP of having no spring. Its sheer German quality. But its grossly overpriced and the seller needs to consider the pricing post GST. Please check from other sources if there is a price drop before hitting the buy.

The unit comes in a semi knocked down condiy in a neat box. For assembly just follow the assembly chart. Forget the WhatsApp distraction by seller because you will be given 1-2 videos at a time which are totally inadequate and will just lead confusing unnecessarily. Instead do read the manual given too.After assembly, fill tank with petrol-oil mix. On the handle is electrical cut off switch to off the engine. On top of the carburettor is a petrol on for running and off for storing toggle lever. Also on side of carburettor is a transparent bubble which is used to clear air from the petrol line and that can be seen in the pipes. On top of the carburettor there are 2 screw adjustments. A small Phillips screw which adjusts the idling speed and a straight notch screw which adjusts the air++fuel ratio. To start adjust this ( maybe 3-4 half turns) until engine starts easily. After running it for 2-3 minutes loosen idling screw until engine runs at a good leisurely speed like a scooter. By pushing down on the wheels the blades are lifted off the ground and can check that the air mixture and idling produce good and immediate acceleration. Otherwise adjust the screws until engine purrs beautiful.I relied on videos and yanking the starter cable unnecessarily have got boils on palm and also got cable out. But have learnt that you can get the starter assembly cheap on Amazon from generic parts supplier.The tilling is very good and tiller is easy to handle. The original mud guard gets caught in the vanes and throws mud on the operator. I bought a truck mud guard , ,cut it to a smaller width upto notch of the flimsy original. It now fits straight and out of the way of the twines and  problem solved.

This 10KG pack of soaked and ready-to-use cocopeat powder has simplified my gardening routine and transformed the way I nurture my plants.What sets this cocopeat powder apart is its convenience. Unlike traditional soil mixes, which can be heavy and cumbersome to transport and handle, this cocopeat powder comes in a lightweight and compact package. It\'s already soaked and prepared, saving me the hassle of having to hydrate it myself. I can simply open the pack and start using it right away, whether I\'m potting plants or preparing seedlings.The quality of the cocopeat powder is exceptional. It\'s finely textured and retains moisture remarkably well, providing the ideal growing medium for a wide range of plants. Whether I\'m growing vegetables, herbs, or ornamental flowers, my plants thrive in this nutrient-rich cocopeat environment. Plus, it\'s naturally pH-balanced, ensuring optimal conditions for healthy root development and overall plant growth.I also appreciate the sustainability aspect of this product. Cocopeat is derived from coconut husks, making it an eco-friendly alternative to traditional soil mixes. By using cocopeat, I\'m reducing my environmental footprint while still achieving excellent results in my garden.Another benefit of cocopeat is its versatility. It can be used not only as a potting mix but also as a soil amendment or mulch. I\'ve found that adding cocopeat to my garden beds helps improve soil structure, retain moisture, and suppress weeds, resulting in healthier and more productive plants.Overall, I couldn\'t be happier with the GoCoir Products® Cocopeat Powder. It\'s convenient, high-quality, and eco-friendly, making it a must-have for any gardener. Whether you\'re a novice or experienced gardener, I highly recommend giving cocopeat a try. It\'s sure to take your gardening experience to the next level.','True','B09PB2BZR5','POSITIVE'),(5734,4,'Good Quality','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3DJA64OEKP5LS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09PB2BZR5','Reviewed in India on 8 February 2024','Value for money','True','B09PB2BZR5','POSITIVE'),(5735,3,'Plants ','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R3CJL0O43DW19U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09PB2BZR5','Reviewed in India on 25 July 2024','Good quality','True','B09PB2BZR5','POSITIVE'),(5736,5,'Amazing product','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R4JWDBMG3N24D/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B09PB2BZR5','Reviewed in India on 8 July 2024','Product quality was very good and certainly is value for money.

This product is very good, a few things to share:1 – The pump would auto-off when the output water flow is stopped, and would auto-on when you let the water flow again; this is a pressure pump.1 – You would get good pressure ONLY if you use a watergun that has the little hole at front, and not a \"circle\" type, from where water is ejected, see picture. The pump works similar to an RO pump, but differently than a jet/monobloc pump.2 – If you face problem with the threaded design at pump output, simply pass a usual garden pipe (½\") over it, and tighten it with the metal-ring with the bolt (available commonly at any hardware store, see picture - I\'ve loosened the ring to get a good view). This gives better result than using the small plastic pieces given along with the unit. The water inlet uses a ¼\" pipe, see picture.3 – I used 12 V Battery of a UPS (you can solder two wires from the battery terminals). But the unit consumes good amount of current, so be sure that the copper wires from battery to unit are thick enough, else it would heat up, and the unit would not get proper current.','True','B077Z55JV6','POSITIVE'),(5762,2,'The Pump is good; seller sucks.','https://www.amazon.in/gp/customer-reviews/R23NOYHUOJOW4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077Z55JV6','Reviewed in India on 13 June 2018','The overall pump is good.

I am putting this review after watching lot of videos on this pump on YouTube and then decide to purchase it.
